# 🚀 **No-Touch Infrastructure Automation – Review Checklist**

**PR:** `no-touch-infra-automation` → `main`  
**Branch:** [View on GitHub](https://github.com/wiredchaos/wired-chaos/pull/new/no-touch-infra-automation)  
**Date:** October 1, 2025  

---

## **Reviewer Tasks ✅**

### **1. PR Overview**
- [ ] **Confirm `scripts/no_touch_infra.sh`** contains the full automation logic (251 lines)
- [ ] **Confirm `src/wrangler.toml`** points to `unified-worker.js` with correct environments and KV bindings
- [ ] **Verify workflow file** `.github/workflows/no-touch-automation.yml` exists and is properly configured
- [ ] **Check file permissions** - ensure `no_touch_infra.sh` is executable

### **2. Staging Deployment**
- [ ] **Trigger staging deployment** via script with `STUB_MODE=true`
- [ ] **Verify Worker deployed** to `chaoswired-staging` environment
- [ ] **Confirm all smoke test endpoints** return expected results:
  - [ ] `/health` → 200 OK
  - [ ] `/suite` → Accessible
  - [ ] `/tax` → Accessible  
  - [ ] `/university/*` → Routing works
  - [ ] `/bus/status` → API responds
  - [ ] `/api/*` → Proxy routes correctly

### **3. Safety Checks**
- [ ] **Ensure `STUB_MODE=true`** is enabled for safe testing
- [ ] **Confirm auto-rollback works** if any endpoint fails during testing
- [ ] **Check that no secrets** are committed in the PR (API keys, tokens, etc.)
- [ ] **Verify environment variables** are properly configured in `wrangler.toml`
- [ ] **Test `/ready` command trigger** works in PR comments

### **4. Automation Features**
- [ ] **Test trigger methods:**
  - [ ] `/ready` comment on issue/PR
  - [ ] Push to main branch (automatic)
  - [ ] Manual trigger from GitHub Actions
- [ ] **Verify configuration options:**
  - [ ] `STUB_MODE`: `true/false` toggle works
  - [ ] `AUTO_ROLLBACK`: `true/false` toggle works
  - [ ] `ENVIRONMENT`: `production/staging` environments

### **5. Production Promotion** (⚠️ **OPTIONAL - Only after staging validation**)
- [ ] **Disable `STUB_MODE=false`** only after staging validation passes
- [ ] **Confirm production deployment** works and smoke tests pass
- [ ] **Ensure CI/CodeQL gates** are satisfied before merge
- [ ] **Verify monitoring** and alerting is active post-deployment

### **6. Documentation & Logging**
- [ ] **Verify README** references the new automation script
- [ ] **Confirm deployment docs** are updated with new workflow
- [ ] **Check logging/reporting** workflows are configured correctly
- [ ] **Verify artifact uploads** work for deployment reports

## **🔍 Testing Commands**

### **Safe Staging Test**
```bash
export STUB_MODE=true
export AUTO_ROLLBACK=true
./scripts/no_touch_infra.sh
```

### **Trigger via Comment**
```
/ready
```

### **Manual GitHub Actions**
Go to: Actions → "No-Touch Infrastructure Automation" → "Run workflow"

---

## **⚠️ Critical Requirements**

1. **🚨 STUB_MODE=true for initial testing** - No live deployments until staging validated
2. **🔄 Auto-rollback must be tested** - Verify it works on simulated failures  
3. **🔐 No secrets in code** - All API keys must use environment variables
4. **📊 Smoke tests must pass** - All endpoints responding correctly
5. **📋 GitHub Actions permissions** - Workflow has required repository access

---

## **📝 Comments / Notes**

- **Rollback Behavior**: Any failure in smoke tests should automatically trigger rollback to last green version
- **Zero-Touch Operation**: All deployments are zero-touch; manual intervention only needed for critical errors  
- **Audit Trail**: All staging environment runs are logged in GitHub Actions for audit purposes
- **Security**: Multi-language CodeQL analysis runs automatically on all deployments
- **Monitoring**: Continuous health checks and GitHub Issue creation on failures

---

## **🎯 Success Criteria**

**✅ All boxes above must be checked before merge**

**Expected Results After Merge:**
- 🤖 Unified Command Center: OPERATIONAL
- ⚡ Cloudflare Worker: DEPLOYED (staging → production flow)
- 🌐 Pages Cache: AUTO-PURGED on deployments
- 🧪 Smoke Tests: AUTOMATED (every deployment)
- 📊 Monitoring: ACTIVE (continuous health checks)
- 🔄 Auto-rollback: ENABLED (on any failure)
