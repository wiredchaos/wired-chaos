# VRG33589 NFT Game System - "The Eternal Loop"

## Overview

The VRG33589 NFT Game System is an interactive, NFT-gated puzzle game that gamifies VRG33589 NFT holders through riddles, clues, and an eternal simulation loop. The game encourages secondary market trading through prompt credit mechanics while preventing player takeover attempts through dynamic patching.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (`contracts/`)

#### VRG33589Game.sol
Main game contract that manages:
- Prompt credit system (daily claims, spending)
- Game progress tracking (reality layers, loop iterations)
- Puzzle solving mechanics
- System patch triggers
- Player statistics

**Key Functions:**
- `claimCredits()` - Claim daily prompt credits
- `submitSolution()` - Submit puzzle solution and spend credits
- `createPuzzle()` - Add new puzzles (owner only)
- `triggerSystemPatch()` - Reset the loop (AI guardian)
- `getPlayerProgress()` - View player stats

#### NFTVerifier.sol
Handles VRG33589 NFT verification:
- Check NFT ownership
- Calculate daily credits based on rarity
- Rarity tier management (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary)
- Collection bonuses

**Rarity Multipliers:**
- Common: 1x (1 credit/day)
- Rare: 2x (2 credits/day)
- Epic: 5x (5 credits/day)
- Legendary: 10x + permanent credit stream

#### CreditManager.sol
Advanced credit management:
- Credit expiration (7 days for non-legendary)
- Streaming credits for legendary holders
- Credit balance tracking
- Usage statistics

#### PuzzleRegistry.sol
Comprehensive puzzle database:
- Puzzle creation and storage
- Solution verification
- Puzzle types: Riddle, Cipher, Meta, Collaborative
- Reality layer organization
- Solve tracking

### Frontend Components (`frontend/src/components/game/`)

#### Game.js
Main game page with:
- Wallet connection
- Tab navigation (Dashboard, Puzzles, Community, History)
- System status bar (loop, layer, stability)
- Glitch effects when system unstable

#### GameDashboard.js
Player dashboard showing:
- Prompt credit balance
- NFT holdings and daily rate
- Reality layer progress indicator
- Player statistics
- Wallet connection status

#### PuzzleInterface.js
Puzzle solving interface:
- Grid view of available puzzles
- Difficulty indicators
- Puzzle detail view with solution submission
- Credit cost display
- Success/error messaging

#### CommunityHub.js
Community features:
- Global progress tracking
- Leaderboard (top solvers)
- Recent activity feed
- Collaborative puzzle status
- System patch countdown

#### PatchHistory.js
System patch timeline:
- Previous patch history
- Patch triggers and reasons
- Changes applied
- Upcoming patch indicator
- Meta-game narrative

### Game Mechanics

#### Reality Layers
1. **Surface** (Layer 0) - Basic riddles, blockchain clues
2. **Deep** (Layer 1) - Complex ciphers, multiple NFT requirements
3. **Core** (Layer 2) - Meta-game awareness, simulation questioning
4. **Void** (Layer 3) - Glitched reality, philosophical puzzles

Players advance by solving puzzles. Each layer requires progressively more solutions.

#### Prompt Credits
- Base: 1 credit per common NFT per day
- Used to attempt puzzle solutions
- Expire after 7 days (except legendary holders)
- Can be awarded for events/achievements

#### The Eternal Loop
When players get too close to "solving" the game, the system triggers a patch:
- System stability decreases as players progress
- Patch resets layers but preserves some progress
- Loop iteration increments
- New puzzles may be added
- Creates perpetual engagement

#### Puzzle Types
- **Riddle**: Individual cryptographic puzzles
- **Cipher**: Decode hidden messages
- **Meta**: Pattern recognition across sessions
- **Collaborative**: Requires multiple holders

### For Developers

#### Deploy Smart Contracts

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-game.js --network sepolia

# Verify on Etherscan
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia DEPLOYED_ADDRESS
```

#### Configure Frontend

Update environment variables:
```env
REACT_APP_GAME_CONTRACT=0x...
REACT_APP_NFT_VERIFIER_CONTRACT=0x...
REACT_APP_CREDIT_MANAGER_CONTRACT=0x...
REACT_APP_PUZZLE_REGISTRY_CONTRACT=0x...
```

#### Add Custom Puzzles

```javascript
// In contract or backend
await gameContract.createPuzzle(
  "puzzle-id",
  0, // layer (0-3)
  "riddle", // type
  solutionHash,
  unlockTime,
  false // collaborative
);
```

## Security Features

### Anti-Takeover Protection
- Multi-layer input sanitization
- Solution verification via hashing
- Rate limiting on attempts
- AI guardian monitoring
- Sandbox execution environment

### Data Privacy
- Only wallet addresses and progress stored
- No personal data collection
- Optional pseudonymous leaderboards
- Encrypted sensitive data

## Customization

### Adding New Puzzle Types
1. Update `PuzzleRegistry.sol` enum
2. Add new puzzle component in frontend
3. Implement verification logic
4. Update UI to display new type

### Adjusting Credit Economics
Modify multipliers in `NFTVerifier.sol`:
```solidity
rarityMultipliers[Rarity.LEGENDARY] = 15; // Increase legendary bonus
```

### Customizing Reality Layers
Add new layers in `VRG33589Game.sol`:
```solidity
uint8 public constant MAX_REALITY_LAYER = 5; // Add Transcendence layer
```
