# WIRED CHAOS Dual-Core Deployment Prompt

Use the following condensed command in Gamma's prompt field or Wix AI's automation console to deploy the WIRED CHAOS dual-environment stack described in the expanded specification. This string preserves all critical parameters while staying within typical prompt limits.

```
WIRED CHAOS DUAL-CORE ACTIVATION :: palette #000000/#00FFFF/#FF3131/#39FF14/#FFD700/#FF00FF :: typography Orbitron+Eurostile Bold white-on-black :: watermark "WIRED CHAOS / 33.3 FM DOGECHAIN" -30° gold 45%.

PROOF-OF-SCHOOL (x-wc-namespace:proof-of-school | tag PROOF OF SCHOOL GRID ARCHIVE V1)
Gamma deck "WIRED CHAOS Power Grid Edition / Proof of School Codex" :: 10 slides (1 Invocation cathedral of circuitry, 2-9 Swarm sigil node lore, 10 Benediction) :: each slide = SWARM card :: include Octane-ready prompts + GROK metadata :: render tilt-shift f/1.8 dual-tone cyan/red, black titanium + gold engraving, volumetric fog. Export PDF + TXT archive → Wix Media /proof-of-school/.

BUSINESS CORE (x-wc-namespace:business | tag BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE CORE V1)
Hidden Wix page "WIRED CHAOS Business Infrastructure Core" :: wire to FastAPI+Node.js Swarm via Wix HTTP functions :: retain Anti-Moloch middleware, CI/CD actions, namespace guards, telemetry feeds :: modules Marketing Swarm, Entity Creator, Cipher Core, Health & Triage, Analytics Fabric, Security Scope :: public metrics via /api/telemetry/public for Gamma widgets.

BRIDGE YAML -> Secrets Manager key bridge_config.yaml :: readonly telemetry bridge proof_to_business_observer from business → proof-of-school :: metrics.health, metrics.signal_strength, metrics.alignment_score :: schedule 15m :: encryption SHA3_512+HMAC :: audit /logs/bridge_observer.json :: reference in Gamma telemetry layer.

FLOW: Gamma renders deck → Wix hosts with neon animations → Swarm backend serves live metrics → tag outputs WIRED CHAOS / 33.3 FM DOGECHAIN. Checklist: run Gamma deck, publish via integration, activate Cloudflare namespace separation, verify cinematic codex + operational core, sync telemetry bridge heartbeat every 33m.
```

> **Tip:** Keep the expanded specification handy for onboarding and audits, and use this compressed string for rapid redeployments across Gamma, Wix, or Swarm agents.
