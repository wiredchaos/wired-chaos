# WIRED CHAOS CODEX — Press Bundle

**Tagline:** Where AI feeds itself and learns from the ledger.

## Executive Summary
WIRED CHAOS CODEX introduces a federated Model Arena that fuses GPT-5, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, Perplexity, Bing, and h2oGPT into a dual-engine reasoning stack. The system delivers adaptive routing, ensemble consensus, and air-gapped fallbacks so product teams can orchestrate autonomous intelligence with Web3-native guardrails.

## Headline Angles
1. **WIRED CHAOS launches CODEX — an AI arena where models debate and consensus evolves in real time.**
2. **From feeds to feelings to facts — the WIRED CHAOS Model Arena unifies GPT-5, Gemini, Claude & Perplexity.**
3. **A low-risk Web3 AI stack for the post-API economy — self-hosted, encrypted, and agentic.**

## Feature Matrix
| Capability | Description | Components |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dual-Engine Reasoning | Quota-aware routing between GPT-5 (deep logic) and Gemini 2.5 (multimodal) | GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 |
| Ensemble Consensus | Claude 3 moderation plus Perplexity and Bing fact checks before publishing | Claude 3, Perplexity, Bing |
| Offline Fallback | Local inference mode when external APIs fail | h2oGPT |
| Developer Layer | Chaos SDK, GitHub Copilot tasks, VS Code automations | Copilot, VS Code |
| Web3 Autonomy | Walletless auth and read-only chain observability | Thirdweb, dRPC |
| Automation Reactor | FreshRSS → n8n → social distribution | FreshRSS, n8n |
| Vaulted Security | Zero-knowledge storage for keys, mnemonics, and agent secrets | Bitwarden |
| Contract Transparency | Agent-triggered decompilation for on-chain contracts | SuiGPT MAD |

## Architecture Snapshot
- Model Arena Router: arena/ coordinates task intents, consensus voting, and failover logic.
- Chaos SDK: sdk/ exposes TypeScript and Python bindings with quota-aware retries and usage telemetry.
- AgentKit Bridge: agentkit/ links Gemini streaming to GPT-5 long-form planning and Claude tone calibration.
- Security Baseline: security/ stores automation manifests for Bitwarden, FreshRSS, n8n, and dRPC provisioning.
- Docs: docs/ compiles the press bundle, whitepaper, and investor deck.

## Security Baseline Highlights
- FreshRSS self-hosted feed ingestion for provenance.
- n8n local workflow runner to avoid untrusted SaaS chains.
- Bitwarden vault for AES-256 encrypted secret storage.
- dRPC read-only chain access to eliminate write privileges.
- Thirdweb walletless authentication for safer onboarding.
- SuiGPT MAD contract inspection before any Web3 execution.
- h2oGPT air-gapped agent for sensitive operations.

## SDK + API Integration Notes
- REST and WebSocket endpoints for GPT-5 / Gemini requests with fallback tokens.
- Streaming callbacks to Claude for ethical tone scoring prior to publishing.
- Perplexity and Bing search invoked through orchestrated research tasks.
- Local adapters for h2oGPT to serve as cold-standby inference.

## Roadmap
- **Q2 2025:** Release Arena governance dashboard with consensus audit trails.
- **Q3 2025:** Ship self-tuning agent recipes and third-party plugin marketplace.
- **Q4 2025:** Introduce automated compliance scanners and red-team sandboxing.
- **Beyond:** Autonomous infrastructure scaling and self-healing operations.
