- **emergency-production.yml**: Emergency deployment workflow for critical fixes

### Enhanced Public Pages
- **public/index.html**: Emergency production motherboard with navigation system
- **public/404.html**: Cyberpunk-themed 404 error page with auto-redirect

### Key Features

#### üåê Emergency Production Environment
- **Cyber-themed UI** with animated grid background
- **Navigation system** routing to /school with section parameters
- **API health monitoring** with real-time status updates
- **Responsive design** for all device types

#### ‚ö° Automated Deployment
- **Multi-stage deployment** with testing, building, and deployment phases
- **Smoke tests** for health verification
- **Emergency deployment** capability with manual trigger
- **Notification system** for deployment status

#### üîß Infrastructure Components
- **Cloudflare Workers** deployment automation
- **Cloudflare Pages** frontend deployment
- **Backend services** deployment configuration
- **Health monitoring** and status checks

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Automatic Deployment
The workflows will automatically trigger on:
- Push to main branch
- Pull request to main branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Emergency Deployment
Use the emergency workflow for critical fixes:
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "üö® Emergency Production Deploy"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Provide deployment reason
5. Deploy

### Required Secrets
Configure these secrets in GitHub repository settings:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`
- `BACKEND_API_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`

## üìä Status Monitoring

### Health Endpoints
- **Frontend**: https://wired-chaos.pages.dev/health
- **Worker**: https://wired-chaos-worker.wiredchaos.workers.dev/health
- **Main Page**: https://wired-chaos.pages.dev/

### Navigation System
The emergency production environment routes all navigation through:
- Base route: `/school`
- Section routing: `/school?section={section}`
- Available sections: neurolab, vault33, fm333, csn, vrg33589, bwb, eveningvibes, b2b
