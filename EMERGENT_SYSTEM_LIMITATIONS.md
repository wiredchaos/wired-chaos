## üõ†Ô∏è Triage & Escalation Workflow

1. **Identify**: When a task cannot be handled by the emergent/automation system, add it to the table above.
2. **Label**: Use one of the following labels for routing:
   - `[SWARM BOT]` ‚Äì For automation/escalation to SWARM bot
   - `[VS CODE TASK]` ‚Äì For export as a VS Code task
   - `[MANUAL]` ‚Äì For manual review or intervention
3. **Assign**: Route the item to the appropriate handler (SWARM bot, VS Code, or manual assignee).
4. **Update**: Mark the status as `Open`, `In Progress`, or `Resolved` as appropriate.
