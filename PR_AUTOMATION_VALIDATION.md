## üß™ Validation Tests

### Test 1: Comment-Driven Automation
**Objective:** Verify `/ready` command triggers full automation

**Steps:**
1. Create a test PR (draft or ready)
2. Comment `/ready` on the PR
3. Verify workflow runs in GitHub Actions
4. Confirm PR is marked ready
5. Confirm PR is merged
6. Confirm branch is deleted
7. Confirm Edge Smoke Tests are triggered

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ PR is automatically ready, merged, cleaned up, and tested

**Command (GitHub CLI):**
```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "/ready"
```

**VS Code Task:**
```
Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí Tasks: Run Task ‚Üí PR: /ready (auto-ready & merge current PR)
```

### Test 2: Label-Driven Automation
**Objective:** Verify `automerge` label triggers scheduled automation

**Steps:**
1. Create a test PR from an authorized author (wiredchaos or Copilot)
2. Add the `automerge` label to the PR
3. Wait for next scheduled run (every 6 hours) OR trigger manually
4. Verify workflow processes the PR
5. Confirm PR is merged and cleaned up

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ PR is automatically processed in next scheduled run

**Command (GitHub CLI):**
```bash
gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --add-label automerge
```

**VS Code Task:**
```
Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí Tasks: Run Task ‚Üí PR: Add automerge label
```

### Test 3: Manual Workflow Dispatch
**Objective:** Verify manual trigger works with custom options

**Steps:**
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí üöÄ Comment Ready & Merge
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter PR number and custom options
4. Verify workflow runs with specified options

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Workflow runs with custom merge method and options

**VS Code Task:**
```
Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí Tasks: Run Task ‚Üí PR: Manual ready & merge (workflow dispatch)
```

### Test 4: Edge Smoke Tests
**Objective:** Verify Edge Smoke Tests can be triggered independently

**Steps:**
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí üî• Edge Smoke Tests
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Verify tests execute successfully
4. Check test report artifact

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Smoke tests run and generate report

**Command (GitHub CLI):**
```bash
gh workflow run "Edge Smoke Tests"
```

**VS Code Task:**
```
Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí Tasks: Run Task ‚Üí PR: Trigger Edge Smoke Tests
```

## üéÆ Quick Start Guide

### For First-Time Users

1. **Install Prerequisites:**
   ```bash
   # Install GitHub CLI
   # Windows: winget install --id GitHub.cli
   # macOS: brew install gh
   # Linux: See https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
   
   # Authenticate
   gh auth login
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code:**
   - Open the WIRED CHAOS repository folder in VS Code

3. **Run Your First Automation:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
   - Type "Tasks: Run Task"
   - Select "PR: /ready (auto-ready & merge current PR)"
   - Enter a PR number
   - Watch the magic happen! üéâ

### Common Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: Immediate Merge
When you want to merge a PR right now:
```
Comment: /ready
Result: PR is ready, merged, and tested within minutes
```

#### Use Case 2: Scheduled Merge
When you want to queue a PR for the next batch:
```
Add label: automerge
Result: PR will be processed in the next 6-hour cycle
```

#### Use Case 3: Custom Merge Options
When you need specific merge settings:
```
Actions ‚Üí Comment Ready & Merge ‚Üí Run workflow
Options: Choose merge method, branch deletion
Result: PR merged with your specified options
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Triggering
**Problem:** Comment or label doesn't trigger workflow

**Solutions:**
1. Check authorization - Only repo owner/admin/maintainer can trigger
2. Verify comment format - Must be `/ready` or `ready` at start of comment
3. Check workflow runs in Actions tab
4. Use manual fallback: Actions ‚Üí Run workflow

### Merge Failed
**Problem:** PR merge failed

**Solutions:**
1. Check if PR has conflicts - Resolve conflicts first
2. Verify checks passed - Some repos require passing checks
3. Check logs in Actions tab for detailed error
4. Use manual merge as fallback: `gh pr merge <PR> --squash`

### Edge Smoke Tests Not Triggered
**Problem:** Smoke tests didn't run after merge

**Solutions:**
1. Trigger manually: `gh workflow run "Edge Smoke Tests"`
2. Check workflow exists: `gh workflow list`
3. Verify workflow name matches exactly: "Edge Smoke Tests"

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know the system is working when:

‚úÖ Single `/ready` comment merges a PR without any other action
‚úÖ PRs with `automerge` label are automatically processed every 6 hours
‚úÖ VS Code tasks work without leaving the editor
‚úÖ Edge Smoke Tests run after every merge
‚úÖ Branches are automatically cleaned up
‚úÖ No manual intervention needed for routine PRs
