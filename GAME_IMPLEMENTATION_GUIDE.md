# VRG33589 Game System - Implementation Guide

## Quick Start

The VRG33589 NFT Game System has been fully implemented and integrated into the WIRED CHAOS platform. **VRG33589 is an XRPL (XRP Ledger) NFT project**, and the game is designed to work with XRPL wallets and NFTs.

Here's how to access and use it:

### Accessing the Game

The game is available at two routes:
- `/game` - Main game interface
- `/game/eternal-loop` - Alternative route (same interface)

## How It Works

### 1. Player Onboarding

```
Player connects XRPL wallet (Xaman/Crossmark) â†’ System queries XRPL for VRG33589 NFTs â†’ 
Credits calculated based on NFT rarity â†’ Game state initialized
```

### 2. Gameplay Loop

```
Claim daily credits â†’ Select puzzle â†’ Submit solution â†’ 
Spend credit â†’ If correct: gain points + advance â†’ 
If incorrect: try again (spend credit)
```

### 3. Layer Progression

```
Surface (0-3 puzzles) â†’ Deep (4-8 puzzles) â†’ 
Core (9-15 puzzles) â†’ Void (15+ puzzles)
```

### 4. The Eternal Loop

```
Players progress â†’ System stability decreases â†’ 
Triggers threshold reached â†’ Patch deployed â†’ 
Loop resets (partial progress preserved) â†’ Iteration increments
```

## Integration Points

### Add Game Link to Navigation

```javascript
// In your navigation component
<Link to="/game">VRG33589 Game</Link>
```

### Add to Motherboard Hub

```javascript
// In MotherboardHub or similar
const gameNode = {
  id: 'vrg33589',
  name: 'VRG33589',
  icon: 'ðŸŒ€',
  title: 'The Eternal Loop',
  description: 'NFT Puzzle Game',
  route: '/game'
};
```

### Integrate with VRG Widget

```javascript
// In VRGWidget.js
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

<Link to="/game" className="vrg-game-link">
  ðŸŽ® Play The Eternal Loop
</Link>
```

## Testing the Game

### Demo Mode (No Wallet Required)

The game includes a demo mode that works without a real Web3 wallet:

1. Navigate to `/game`
2. Click "Connect Wallet" 
3. Demo wallet automatically created
4. Start with 5 credits
5. Try solving sample puzzles

### Sample Puzzle Answers

For testing purposes, here are some sample answers:

- Puzzle 1 "The Beginning": `loop`, `simulation`
- Puzzle 2 "Hidden Message": `vrg33589`, `VRG33589`
- Puzzle 3 "Reality Check": `four`, `4`

### Testing Scenarios

**Basic Flow:**
```bash
1. Load /game
2. Connect wallet (demo mode)
3. View Dashboard tab
4. Claim daily credits
5. Switch to Puzzles tab
6. Select a puzzle
7. Submit solution
8. Check credit deduction
9. View updated stats
```

**Community Features:**
```bash
1. Switch to Community tab
2. View leaderboard
3. Check global progress
4. Monitor patch countdown
5. View recent activity
```

**Loop Mechanics:**
```bash
1. Solve multiple puzzles
2. Watch system stability decrease
3. Advance through layers
4. Trigger system patch at 20% stability
5. View patch in History tab
6. Continue in new loop iteration
```

## Customization

### Add New Puzzles

Edit `puzzle-solver.js`:

```javascript
const allPuzzles = [
  {
    id: '7',
    layer: 1,
    type: 'riddle',
    title: 'Your Puzzle',
    content: 'Your riddle text',
    difficulty: 3,
    unlocked: true
  },
  // ... more puzzles
];

// Add correct answer
const correctAnswers = {
  '7': ['answer1', 'answer2'],
  // ...
};
```

### Adjust Credit Economics

Edit `credit-tracker.js`:

```javascript
const calculateDailyAmount = (nftData) => {
  // Modify rarity bonuses
  case 'LEGENDARY':
    amount += 20; // Increase from 10
    break;
  
  // Adjust collection bonuses
  if (nftData.count >= 3) { // Lower threshold
    amount += 5; // Higher bonus
  }
};
```

### Change Layer Requirements

Edit `loop-manager.js`:

```javascript
const layerRequirements = {
  0: 0,  // Surface
  1: 2,  // Deep - reduced from 3
  2: 5,  // Core - reduced from 8
  3: 10  // Void - reduced from 15
};
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Add analytics tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Wallet Not Connecting**
- Check if MetaMask is installed
- Verify network is correct
- Try demo mode for testing

**Credits Not Updating**

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips

1. **Lazy Loading**: Game components are already code-split
2. **Local Storage**: Game state cached for fast access
3. **Minimal API Calls**: Most logic runs client-side
4. **Efficient Re-renders**: React memo and useCallback used

### Browser Compatibility

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Create API for dynamic puzzle loading
   - Implement server-side solution verification
   - Add real-time leaderboard updates

2. **Smart Contract Integration**
   - Connect to actual deployed contracts
   - Implement real NFT verification
   - Add on-chain solution storage

3. **Advanced Features**
