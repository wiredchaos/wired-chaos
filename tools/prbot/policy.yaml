# Default CODEX PR review policy for WIRED CHAOS.
#
# The structure is intentionally lightweight so maintainers can add additional
# rules without writing Python. Update ``batches`` to group related pull
# requests and expand the ``rules`` map with pattern-based policies.

batches:
  nightly-automerge:
    - "chore: dependency updates"
    - "docs: automated handbook refresh"

rules:
  security-critical:
    label: "security"
    match: "^security:"  # Titles beginning with "security:"
    steps:
      - "security.scan"
      - "security.notify"
    automerge: false

  automerge-default:
