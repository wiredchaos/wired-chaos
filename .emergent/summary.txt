The AI engineer's work trajectory details the iterative development of the WIRED CHAOS digital ecosystem. Initially, the focus was on building a React/FastAPI application with core features like a motherboard UI, sub-agent routing, and referral tracking. Significant progress included implementing an AI Bot Brain (FastAPI), branding and social links (React), and fixing a VRG-33-589 mint supply bug.

A major architectural decision was the introduction and separate deployment of the VAULT33 Gatekeeper system (FastAPI, MongoDB, Discord/Telegram bots) to handle gamification, mint/burn validation, and hidden path logic. This was prioritized over frontend work. Subsequently, the AI integrated a comprehensive blog, CSN live streaming, and Evening Vibes Lounge into the existing React frontend.

The development pivoted towards a Universal Motherboard OS visual concept for the UI, initially with experimental 3D, followed by a user-requested ROLLBACK + LOCKED THEME to a refined 2D motherboard layout with specific aesthetic guidelines and feature flags. The AI is currently poised to implement this rollback, focusing on styling, component structure, and backend integrations.

The WIRED CHAOS digital hub is a motherboard-style application serving as a central router for various sub-agents: CSN, NEURO LAB, BWB, Vault33, B2B, VRG-33-589. Key features include a cyberpunk neon grid UI with animated nodes, dedicated pages for each sub-agent, and a referral tracking form. Live feeds (Spotify, RSS, Chirp), SEO ghost pages, and WL Gamification (Vault33) with a Secret Merovigian Sigil are central. A WIRED CHAOS Bot Brain handles greetings and routing. Specific pages like 33.3 FM and Evening Vibes Lounge, along with Merch Hubs, contribute to a rich ecosystem. The aesthetic requires a transparent black brain with cyan/red veins and barbed wire. Recent updates involved removing Shibo/BarkMeta, adding WiredChaos.xyz, and integrating a Lurky referral link. A critical bug with VRG-33-589 mint supply (should be 3,933 keys in 9 layers of 333) was fixed. The VAULT33 Gatekeeper system, a separate Discord/Telegram bot with FastAPI webhooks and MongoDB, manages whitelist gamification, mint/burn validation, raffle tickets, and a Merovingian hidden path. The UI is evolving towards a Universal Motherboard OS aesthetic, with current instructions to implement a refined Motherboard City Panels layout.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had started implementing the Universal Motherboard OS visual concept. This involved creating new CSS () and React components (, , ) to transform the main hub into a motherboard-like interface. These styles and components were integrated into  and .

The user then provided a new MEGA PROMPT for a ROLLBACK + LOCKED THEME, which refines the motherboard concept. This new directive emphasizes reverting to a previous motherboard city panels layout, removing experimental 3D transforms, restoring specific brand palette colors (black/cyan/teal with neon red/orange accents), locking typography, and ensuring existing blog/groups/live blocks function correctly. Crucially, it instructs the creation of a  to control 3D rendering and provides exact code patches for  and  to define the new visual and structural rules. It also details how to rebuild , , , and structure SEO ghost pages, and routing. The AI engineer acknowledged this as the chosen approach and is about to begin implementing this rollback plan.
