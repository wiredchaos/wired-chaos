The AI engineer's work evolved through several distinct phases. Initially, it focused on a ROLLBACK + LOCKED THEME for the Universal Motherboard OS, creating feature flags, restoring base styles, and isolating MotherboardUI components. After successfully reverting to a legacy UI and validating existing functionalities (blog, live feeds), the user introduced a comprehensive MEGA PROMPT detailing two stack paths (React/FastAPI or Next.js/Three.js). The AI continued with the React/FastAPI path, implementing a new  and SEO files, and debugging the new UI. Subsequently, the AI integrated two complex hologram components (Business Neuro Lab and NFT Neuro Meta X) into the NEURO LAB page, followed by a large-scale project to build a multi-chain NFT certificate system with FastAPI backend integration. Most recently, it enhanced the NEURO META X page with a consolidated design, advanced holograms, and voice synthesis.

The WIRED CHAOS digital hub is a motherboard-style app routing various sub-agents (CSN, NEURO LAB, BWB, Vault33, B2B, VRG-33-589). It features a cyberpunk neon grid UI, dynamic content, referral tracking, live feeds, SEO ghost pages, and WL Gamification (Vault33). A WIRED CHAOS Bot Brain manages interactions. The UI vision shifted to a Universal Motherboard OS, initially 3D, then rolled back to a refined Motherboard City Panels 2D layout. Recent work included integrating sophisticated NEURO LAB holograms with cycling images, audio, and voice synthesis. The latest major requirement is the NEUROLAB ACADEMY multi-chain NFT certificate system, supporting Ethereum (Sepolia), Solana (Devnet), XRPL (Testnet), Hedera (Testnet), and a Dogecoin (Testnet) stub, with IPFS metadata pinning and a unified API endpoint for minting.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the NEURO META X page. This involved a major update to the  React component and its corresponding CSS () to match a more advanced design provided by the user. This new design integrated the two previously created hologram components (Business Neuro Lab and NFT Neuro Meta X) directly into the page's hero section, alongside updated about neuro and about wired chaos cards, consolidating the page's visual and functional elements.

Key updates included:
- ** and **: Modified to incorporate shared hologram styles, new button styles, and the overall layout for the consolidated NEURO META X page.
- ** and **: Enhanced to support advanced features like voice synthesis (), more dynamic audio effects (,  helper), and improved hologram animations (flicker, jitter, hover effects) as specified in the latest MEGA PROMPT.
- ****: The routing for the NEURO META X page was already in place, but the internal rendering logic within  now orchestrates the dual holograms directly.

The latest action was taking a screenshot of the enhanced NEURO META X page after these updates.
