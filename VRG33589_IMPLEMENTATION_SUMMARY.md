# VRG33589 NFT Game System - Implementation Summary

## 🎮 Complete Implementation

The VRG33589 NFT Game System "The Eternal Loop" has been **fully implemented** and integrated into the WIRED CHAOS platform.

**Important:** VRG33589 is an **XRPL (XRP Ledger) NFT project**. The game integrates with XRPL wallets and queries the XRPL network for NFT ownership verification.
