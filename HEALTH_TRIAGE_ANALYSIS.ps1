Your infrastructure has sophisticated triage and health monitoring
with zero-downtime maintenance capabilities. Individual sections
can be unavailable without affecting the entire system.

TRIGGERS IN PLACE:
‚Ä¢ Health check failures ‚Üí Circuit breaker activation
‚Ä¢ Component errors ‚Üí Graceful degradation mode  
‚Ä¢ Critical issues ‚Üí Emergency deployment pipeline
‚Ä¢ Network issues ‚Üí Offline mode with auto-recovery
