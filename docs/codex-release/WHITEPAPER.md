# 1. Introduction
WIRED CHAOS CODEX is an agentic Model Arena that enables autonomous coordination between large language models, Web3 telemetry, and developer automation. The platform emphasises dual-engine reasoning, verifiable consensus, and a low-risk security posture for the post-API economy.

# 2. System Overview
- Primary Reasoner: OpenAI GPT-5 for deep planning and reflection.
- Multimodal Specialist: Gemini 2.5 Flash / Pro for image, audio, and code synthesis.
- Ethical Voice: Claude 3 ensures tone, compliance, and narrative balance.
- Research Mesh: Perplexity AI plus Bing Search deliver real-time citations.
- Offline Fallback: h2oGPT runs locally for air-gapped operations.
- Automation Layer: GitHub Copilot + VS Code tasks orchestrate developer workflows.
- Web3 Stack: FreshRSS, n8n, Bitwarden, dRPC, Thirdweb, and SuiGPT MAD uphold the low-risk security baseline.

# 3. Arena Routing Logic
```
if task.requires_web: bing + perplexity
elif task.requires_multimodal: gemini
elif task.requires_deep_reasoning: gpt5
elif task.requires_tone: claude
else: gpt5

if api_failure: h2oGPT
result = consensus_vote(models)
publish(result)
```

# 4. Repository Layout
- sdk/ — TypeScript and Python bindings, rate limiting, and usage analytics.
- agentkit/ — Gemini ↔ GPT bridge, Claude moderation hooks, streaming transport.
- arena/ — Task classifier, router, consensus orchestrator, and fallback policies.
- security/ — Infrastructure-as-code for Bitwarden, FreshRSS, n8n, dRPC, Thirdweb, SuiGPT MAD.
- docs/ — Press assets, whitepaper source, and investor communications.

# 5. Security Baseline
| Control | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| FreshRSS | Own the ingestion pipeline and maintain provenance of sources. |
| n8n | Run orchestration locally, enforce deterministic workflows. |
| Bitwarden | Zero-knowledge vault for API keys, mnemonics, and credentials. |
| dRPC | Read-only chain access to prevent unauthorized writes. |
| Thirdweb | Walletless auth for safe onboarding in dev/test environments. |
| SuiGPT MAD | Local contract decompiler to inspect smart contracts before execution. |
| h2oGPT | Air-gapped fallback when external APIs are unavailable or untrusted. |

# 6. SDK & API Integration
- Multi-tenant API keys with quota awareness and circuit breakers.
- Event-driven hooks to refresh FreshRSS feeds and trigger n8n tasks.
- Developer CLI for generating API tokens and scaffolding agent recipes.
- Reference implementations for Python, TypeScript, and serverless adapters.

# 7. Roadmap & Future Work
1. Governance telemetry with consensus heatmaps and arbitration history.
2. Self-tuning prompts sourced from on-chain analytics and user feedback loops.
3. Autonomous deployments that evaluate diffs, open PRs, and push to staging.
4. Infrastructure autonomy with SLO monitoring, self-healing, and safe rollbacks.

# 8. Contribution Guide
- Fork the repository and create feature branches.
- Run npm run codex:press-kit to regenerate the press bundle locally.
- Submit PRs with design notes and safety considerations.
- Join the community call on 33.3 FM DOGECHAIN for live syncs.
